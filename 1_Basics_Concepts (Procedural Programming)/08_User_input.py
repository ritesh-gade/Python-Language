# User Input: In python, we can take user input directly by using input() function. 
# This input function gives a return value as string/character hence we have to pass thet into variable.

# Eg:-1)

variable = input("Enter Your Name:")
print("My name is:",variable)

# Eg:-2)
X = input("Enter First Number:")
Y = input("Enter Second Number:")

print("This is String:", X + Y)
print("Now we Can Change Integer:",int(X) + int(Y))
